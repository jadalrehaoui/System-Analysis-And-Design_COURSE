# System-Analysis-And-Design_COURSE

This is a design and analysis for the DriverPass Project. DriverPass is a company that need to grab more audience through having an online portal allowing
their customers to purchase learning packages through a web page. They are specialized with teaching driving test takers the DMV rules and training them to
drive their cars. They offer theoretic and practice lesson which are included in the packages they put together.

In this design, I drew Unified Modeling Language diagrams to define how the system should behave, who are the actors, the relationships between classes in
the system and the activities that the system has. 
For example, the UML Activity Diagram for purchasing a package is drawn in the Purchase Material Activity Diagram file.
We also held interviews with the customer (DriverPass owner and his IT lead) where we discussed how they want their system to be and what are the main 
features they want their system to have. I have taken notes about these interviews in the notes file attached.
I designed a Gantt chart, to specify each sprint outcome and how long will it take so we have a clear path to track our work and progress. 
By the end of our analysis, I worked on a presentation, to showcase the project and its functionalities based on the customer business requirements.

I am a little not sure about the Use Case Diagram since it still looks a little complicated and some lacking some relationships. I would go back and revise
it and simplify where I can. I would also reach to someone more experienced in Use Case diagrams to guide me through if possible.

This system is made for users to access it and make their work more efficient. Listening to the users' feedback and complaints about the system is a good 
way to point new development activities or design ones. Maintaining the system is also a way to hear from users where they are having difficulties or 
redundancies so that we can adjust and update the system. Taking notes when listening to users' feedback and brainstorming ways to get their needs matched
in an efficient was a good thing that I did so that I have a summarized set of notes and ideas to be worked on.

I approach software design as a puzzle to be put together, first we start by gathering information about the software and the business. How do they perform
actions, what actions are more important than others, what is depending on what, and what they are trying to reach performing each activity. Just like a
puzzle, you need the bigger picture first, sort the pieces that look like they belong in the same area, and see how they match together.
Then we start analyzing, looking for redundancies and sketching models. Analyzing makes it easier to understand the business and helps us to come up with 
more efficient and effective ways to reach a result. 
After analyzing comes design, and this is where we start by modeling the ideas we came up with into charts and diagrams, putting everything into visuals.
When the models are confirmed, we start the implementation which is all about coding and testing, relying on the design we put together earlier.
At the end comes deployment and maintenance where we keep updating the system where it needs to be updated, and listening to customers' and users' feedback.
